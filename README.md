## What it's Chorus ?
[Clone Hero-friendly Organized Repository of User-provided Songs](https://chorus.fightthe.pw/) it's a open source project from [@Paturages](https://github.com/Paturages)

>From [Chorus](https://chorus.fightthe.pw/) README.md
>
>**chorus** periodically imports links to songs from a list of mostly Google Drive folders (manually provided in the sources folder). It crawls the provided folders, downloads the `.chart`/`.mid` and `song.ini` files (or entire archives) to parse them for information, formally saves the links (**not the song bundles themselves**) and their metadata in a database and discards the downloaded items. The web app simply reads and searches from the data that is saved in the database.
